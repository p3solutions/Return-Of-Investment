                    <p>There are many benefits to archiving and decommissioning applications, and this calculator will highlight some of these benefits, including cost reductions, based on a variety of interactive inputs.</p>

                        <h2 class="StepTitle">Legacy Application Decommissioning Use Case</h2>
                          <p>This analysis includes a decommission-able application environment consisting of {{input11}} legacy applications which are, on average, {{input12}} years old, and which in total cost the organization {{input13}} annually in support and maintenance charges</p>
                          <p>The infrastructure footprint to run these legacy applications includes {{input14}} mainframes and {{input15}} physical servers</p>
                          <p>In total, there is assumed to be {{input16}} TBs associated with these applications residing on {{input17}} storage which is replicated. Weekly full backups are made of this data and are retained indefinitely</p>
                        <h2 class="StepTitle">Active archive of Live Apps Use Case</h2>
                          <p>This analysis includes an actively archived application environment consisting of {{input21}} live applications which are, on average, {{input22}} years old. The data from these applications is generally able to be archived after {{input23}} months.</p>
                          <p>The server footprint to support these applications is growing at a rate of {{input24}} servers annually. It is estimated that through active archiving server growth can be reduced by {{input25}} and that each server added carries with it a {{input26}} application licensing cost.</p>
                          <p>In total, there is assumed to be {{input27}} TBs associated with these applications residing on high-end storage which is replicated. Additionally, this data is assumed to be growing at a {{input210}} rate annually. Weekly full backups are made of this data and are retained indefinitely.</p>
                        <h2 class="StepTitle">Additional Organization-wide Assumptions</h2>
                          <p>This model assumes a disk-to-tape backup architecture leveraging {{input31}} disk backup appliances which are appropriately sized to meet a {{input32}} hour backup window (based on publicly available Data Domain specs).</p>
                          <p>Aggregating all of the applications above, a total of {{input33+input34+input35}} retrieval requests are assumed to take place each year. Requests include those made by employees and customers, regulatory agencies, and those which are a part of legal e-discovery initiatives</p>
                          <p>Finally that average annual salary for IT employees is estimated as {{input36}}</p>
                        <h2 class="StepTitle">By analyzing these use cases and key environmental characteristics, this model provides estimates for the financial impact your organization could expect by investing in InfoArchive compared to the status quo.
